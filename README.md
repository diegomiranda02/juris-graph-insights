# Graph Data Analysis with Python in the Law Area

## Introduction

The legal field has recently been using advanced technologies and methodologies to help lawyers, judges and legal professionals make more informed and data-driven decisions. With the growing volume of data available, graph data analysis has become a powerful approach to understanding the complex relationships between lawsuits, decisions, lawyers, parties to the lawsuit, articles, laws, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs. In this article, we will explore how Python can be a valuable tool to access and analyze data from a graph database and demonstrate the potential of this approach in the field of law, using as a hypothetical example a law firm using these analyzes and applying them in decision-making.

## Examples that will be implemented in this article, in Python

> 1. Suppose a lawyer has received a case in the area of ​​Environmental Law and there is already a judge assigned to the case. It would be useful for this lawyer to profile a judge by identifying which legal provisions this judge relies on the most:

> What laws does this judge base his decisions on in the environmental area?

> 2. We can think of another practical situation using "What If" analysis, or scenario analysis. In this type of analysis it is possible to simulate different legal scenarios, examining how changes in certain laws or connections affect other elements of the legal system. Imagine that a new law on environmental regulation is being discussed by the legislature and that some articles, paragraphs and items in a certain law are going to be changed. For the lawyer, a useful question would be

> Which processes that I am responsible for could have impacts with the amendment of the current environmental law?

> 3. Or in the case of the law firm, an important question to be answered would be:

> Which processes that are being conducted here at the office could have an impact with the change in the current environmental law?

> 4. It would also be possible for the firm to analyze which articles and laws have the most impact on process decisions to guide its lawyers:

> Determine which laws and paragraphs have the greatest impact on court decisions.

** We will have these four examples to implement, but which can be expanded to all types of law: tax, social security, civil, etc. After each implementation, the graphical view of the connection network will be shown to understand the relationships between the nodes. **
